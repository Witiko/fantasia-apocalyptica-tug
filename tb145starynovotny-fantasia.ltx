\begin{abstract}
On October 11, 2019, the Czech premiere of the multimedia work \emph{Fantasia Apocalyptica} took place at Masaryk University, marking the 25th anniversary of its Faculty of Informatics and featuring the composer and author Donald Knuth. The performance was recorded and later \href{https://youtu.be/wk7dEKMPP68}{published on the faculty's YouTube channel}.

In this article, written on the occasion of Knuth's 88th birthday, I describe the complete preparation of the recording, from processing the raw audio and video footage through recreating the projection panels that accompanied the performance to assembling the final master. With the exception of super-resolution enhancement, introductory and closing edits, and audio compression, the workflow relies exclusively on free and open-source tools, including \TeX, Audacity, Aegisub, FFmpeg, \acro{MLT}, \acro{PDF}tk, and ImageMagick. The article explains how these tools can be combined into a practical, reproducible workflow that readers may apply to their own recordings.
